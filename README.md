# Path-planning
This project was part of a summer research internship at the Illinois Institute of Technology, under Professor Sanjiv Kapoor's orientation.

After studying Professor Kapoor's "Rectilinear shortest paths through polygonal obstacles in O(n(logn)2) time" paper, we designed an algorithm for the 3D version of this problem: given a 3D terrain surface, we find a rectilinear shortest path that avoids polygonal obstacles in O(n2(logn)2) time. This is the implementation of that algorithm.
